        <p style = "font-size: large;">
            Ven pongal is a traditional, comforting breakfast dish from south India.
            With raw rice and moong dal (lentils) and a mild spice plus flavor from black pepper, cumin, ghee tempering.Perfect winter food, 
            especially made during Tamil month Margazhi. 
            I also make it when I want something comforting as well as easy to make in the weekends.
